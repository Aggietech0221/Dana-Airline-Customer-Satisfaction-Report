## Conclusion and Recommendation

From the insights drawn and analysis done, customers are quite satisfied with factors like cleanliness, on-board service, check-in service, in-flight service and baggage handling. However, considering the low ratings of other factors and the number of dissatisfied returning customers, the in-flight wi-fi service, time convenience, in-flight boarding service as well as food and drinks are most likely to the major reasons for low customer satisfaction percentage that dropped below 50%.
I therefore recommend:

- A strong wi-fi connection should be put in place with reduction in price for customers that might need internet access above the airline budget.

- The arrival and departure time should be adjusted to customers convenience and food and drinks serve should be adjust in taste, quantity and in varieties for customers to choose.

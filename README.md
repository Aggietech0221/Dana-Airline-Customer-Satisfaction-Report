## Conclusion and Recommendation

From the insights drawn and analysis done, customers are quite satisfied with factors like cleanliness, on-board service, check-in service, in-flight service and baggage handling. However, considering the low ratings of other factors and the number of dissatisfied returning customers indicate some factors like the in-flight wi-fi service, time convenience, in-flight boarding service as well as food and drinks are most likely to the major reasons for low customer satisfaction percentage that dropped below 50%.
I therefore recommend:

- A strong wi-fi connection should be put in place with reduction in price for customers that might need internet access above the airline budget.

- The arrival and departure time should be adjusted to customers convenience as well as food and drinks serve should be adjust in taste, quantity and in varieties for customers to choose.
